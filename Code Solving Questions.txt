○     Every number in the sequence, that when divided by 3 produces a remainder (Store the original number AND its remainder in a List or Associative Array, and print it to the screen AFTER printing the prime numbers list)

●      Using any programming language (PHP preferred), implement an algorithm that will reverse the following strings, WITHOUT using native string reversal calls in the language’s API. (String splitting calls are permitted)

○      azerty

○      turgid saxophones blew over mick’s jazzy quaff
