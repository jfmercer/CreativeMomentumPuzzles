Code Solving Questions

Upload your work to a public Github profile.

1) Using any programming language (PHP preferred), implement an algorithm that solves the following 
   for a number sequence from 0-1000:

   a) Return a List or Array of every prime number, and print it to the screen.

   b) Every number in the sequence, that when divided by 3 produces a remainder (Store the original 
      number AND its remainder in a List or Associative Array, and print it to the screen AFTER 
      printing the prime numbers list)

2) Using any programming language (PHP preferred), implement an algorithm that will reverse 
   the following strings, WITHOUT using native string reversal calls in the language’s API. 
   (String splitting calls are permitted)

    a) racecar

    b) azerty

    c) turgid saxophones blew over mick’s jazzy quaff

    d) maximum velocity minimum energy

    e) a man a plan a canal panama

3) Using HTML, JavaScript and jQuery, load this JSON 
   [https://github.com/Enviii/Superheroes/blob/master/js/superheroes.json] and only show all 
   DC Comics superheroes, in alphabetical order by First Name. Feel free to load any additional 
   images or features to enhance the layout. Feel free to use any call in the jQuery API 
   to complete your implementation.

   Note: Please use semantic HTML5 markup when rendering your output. No tables allowed.
