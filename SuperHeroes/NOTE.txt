Nota Bene: Portions of the code for this project were taken from a course I
took on teamtreehouse.com. The instructor and author of the course is
Andrew Chalkley, who can be reached at andrew@chalkley.org, on Twitter at
@chalkers, or on GitHub at http://github.com/chalkers.
The course was "jQuery Basics" and may be found at
